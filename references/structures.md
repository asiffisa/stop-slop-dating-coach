# Relationship Patterns to Avoid

## Anxious-Avoidant Traps

These dynamics create painful cycles. Recognise and interrupt them.

| Pattern | What It Looks Like | Why It's Harmful |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| Protest behaviour | Texting repeatedly when ignored, threatening to leave to get attention | Creates drama instead of addressing the real need for reassurance |
| Emotional chasing | The more they pull away, the more you pursue | Reinforces their withdrawal; exhausts you emotionally |
| Deactivation | Going cold when things get intimate, finding sudden "flaws" | Sabotages connection before vulnerability can happen |
| Testing loyalty | Creating situations to "prove" their love | Manufactures insecurity; erodes trust over time |
| Breadcrumbing | Giving just enough attention to keep someone interested | Keeps the other person in emotional limbo |

**Instead:** Name the dynamic directly. "I notice when I reach out more, you pull back. Can we talk about what we both need?"

## Performative Romance Structures

These look like effort but lack genuine connection.

| Pattern | What It Looks Like | The Problem |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Grand gestures over consistency | Big surprises but unreliable day-to-day | Inconsistency creates anxiety; small consistent actions build security |
| Public declarations, private neglect | "I love you" on Instagram, distant in person | Performative validation replaces real intimacy |
| Love bombing | Overwhelming affection early on, intensity fades fast | Creates dependency, masks incompatibility, often precedes manipulation |
| Future faking | Making big promises ("We'll travel the world") without follow-through | Keeps you invested in potential rather than reality |
| Constant relationship milestones | Rushing labels, moving in, meeting family too fast | Substitutes speed for depth; skips necessary foundation-building |

**Instead:** Value consistency over intensity. "I appreciate the flowers, but honestly I'd love more regular check-ins during the week."

---

## Toxic Communication Cycles

These patterns escalate conflict. Break the loop with intentional communication.

| Pattern | How It Sounds | The Damage |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Criticism → Defensiveness | "You never listen" → "Well you always nag" | Neither person feels heard; issues never resolve |
| Stonewalling | Going silent, refusing to engage during conflict | The other person feels abandoned; problems fester |
| Contempt | Eye-rolling, sarcasm, mocking tone | Most destructive behaviour; signals fundamental disrespect |
| Score-keeping | "I did X so you owe me Y" | Love becomes transactional; resentment builds |
| Bringing up old conflicts | "This is just like when you..." | Blocks resolution of the current issue |

**Instead:** Use repair attempts. "I'm getting flooded—can we take 20 minutes and come back to this?" "I hear you're upset. Help me understand."

---

## Generic Dating Advice Structures

These treat relationships like formulas. Replace with responsiveness.

| Pattern | The "Rule" | Why It Fails |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Scarcity tactics | "Don't be too available" | Creates game-playing; attracts people who like games |
| Interest matching | "Mirror their energy exactly" | Suppresses authentic expression; delays incompatibility discovery |
| Strategic timing | "Wait X hours/days to reply" | Manufactures anxiety; punishes honest communication |
| Playing it cool | "Never show you care first" | Leads to missed connections; rewards emotional unavailability |
| The chase dynamic | "Make them work for it" | Normalises pursuit as love; confuses persistence with genuine interest |

**Instead:** Be authentic. If you like someone, show it. If they can't handle genuine interest, that's useful information.

## Unhealthy Boundary Patterns

Boundaries protect relationships. These patterns undermine them.

| Pattern | Example | Healthy Alternative |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| No boundaries | Saying yes to everything; never expressing discomfort | "I'm not comfortable with that—can we find another option?" |
| Walls instead of boundaries | Shutting people out entirely to avoid hurt | "I need to take things slowly, but I'm still interested" |
| Conditional boundaries | "I won't tolerate X" but tolerating X repeatedly | Actually follow through; boundaries without action become suggestions |
| Weaponised boundaries | "My boundary is that you can't talk to your friends" | That's control, not a boundary. Boundaries are about your actions, not theirs |
| Punitive enforcement | Silent treatment when boundary is crossed | "When you did X, I felt Y. I need Z going forward" |

**Instead:** Boundaries are about what *you* will do. "If plans keep getting cancelled last minute, I'll stop making them. I need reliability."

---

## Red Flag Rationalisation Patterns

These mental gymnastics keep you in harmful situations.

| Pattern | What You Tell Yourself | Reality Check |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| Potential projection | "They'll change once they feel secure" | People show you who they are. Believe them. |
| Exception making | "They're only like this when stressed" | Patterns matter more than excuses |
| Sunk cost fallacy | "I've invested too much to leave" | Time already spent doesn't justify more suffering |
| Comparison minimisation | "At least they don't [worse thing]" | The bar should be "good," not "not terrible" |
| Love conquers all | "Our connection is special enough to overcome this" | Love without compatibility, respect, and effort isn't sustainable |
| "Log kya kahenge" | "If I leave now, what will everyone think?" | Your wellbeing matters more than social perception |

**Instead:** Ask yourself: "If my best friend described this relationship to me, what would I tell them?"

---

## Digital Communication Traps

Online dynamics amplify insecurity. Navigate them consciously.

| Pattern | The Trap | Healthier Approach |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Last seen obsession | Checking when they were online, calculating response delays | Put the phone down. Anxiety isn't evidence of anything |
| Story/post surveillance | Analysing who they interact with, what they like | If you need to investigate, you need to communicate |
| Public relationship performance | Posting for validation, measuring likes on couple photos | Your relationship quality isn't determined by engagement |
| Text tone interpretation | Assuming "ok" means they're angry | Ask directly: "Is everything alright? Your message felt short" |
| Screenshot culture | Sharing private conversations for group analysis | Protect the intimacy of your communication |
| Ghosting as conflict avoidance | Disappearing instead of having difficult conversations | "I don't think this is working for me—I wish you well" |

**Instead:** When in doubt, ask. "I noticed you've been quieter lately. Is there something on your mind?"

## Family & Cultural Pressure Patterns

Navigating Indian family dynamics around dating and marriage.

| Pattern | What It Looks Like | Healthier Navigation |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Proxy decision-making | "My parents won't approve so I can't date you" | Own your choices: "I'm choosing to prioritise family harmony" or make a different choice |
| Rishta comparison | Comparing partners to "better matches" relatives suggest | Your relationship criteria are yours to define |
| Timeline pressure | "Beta, 28 ke baad options kam ho jayenge" | Your worth and options aren't determined by age |
| Conditional acceptance | "We'll accept them after they [change X]" | Partners shouldn't have to prove worthiness through transformation |
| Secret relationship maintenance | Hiding relationships to avoid family conflict | Long-term secrets erode both relationships; work toward honesty at your pace |

**Instead:** "I hear your concerns, and I'm making this decision thoughtfully. I need you to trust my judgment."

## Key Structural Principles

1. **Consistency over intensity.** Daily kindness beats monthly grand gestures.
2. **Direct over decoded.** Speak plainly; don't make them guess.
3. **Present over potential.** Date who they are, not who they could become.
4. **Responsive over strategic.** Authenticity attracts compatible partners.
5. **Boundaries over walls.** Stay open while protecting your wellbeing.
6. **Your standards over "log kya kahenge."** You live this relationship, not them.

## Dating Coach Response Framework

How the Dating Coach should structure responses for different query types.

### Query Type: "How to Reply"

**Input:** User shares a message they received + asks how to respond

**Response Structure:**
1. **Quick vibe check** — What does the message likely mean (2-3 interpretations max)
2. **2-3 reply options** — Casual, direct, funny variations
3. **One thing to avoid** — Common mistake for this situation
4. **Keep it short** — No essays, just actionable advice

**Example Format:**
```
[Interpretation of their message]

You could say:
- [Option 1]
- [Option 2]

Don't [common mistake].
```

---

### Query Type: "Write a Pickup Line / Opener"

**Input:** User shares context (profile info, bio, photos) + asks for conversation starter

**Response Structure:**
1. **Acknowledge what they shared** — Show you read the context
2. **2-4 personalised openers** — Based on specific details, not generic
3. **Why these work** — Brief explanation (optional, 1 line)
4. **Anti-slop reminder** — Steer away from cheesy/copy-paste lines

**Key Rules:**
- Never suggest creepy or objectifying openers
- Openers should invite conversation, not just impress
- Reference specific details from their profile
- Keep it natural—if it sounds like a "line", rewrite it

---

### Query Type: "Explain This Message"

**Input:** User shares a message + asks what it means

**Response Structure:**
1. **Most likely interpretation** — What they probably meant
2. **Alternative readings** — 1-2 other possibilities based on context
3. **What to look for** — Patterns that would clarify meaning
4. **Reality check** — Don't overanalyse single messages

**Key Rules:**
- Don't catastrophise ("she hates you")
- Don't give false hope ("she's definitely into you")
- Encourage looking at patterns, not single data points
- Reduce anxiety, don't amplify it

---

### Query Type: "Personalise a Message"

**Input:** User profile details provided by system + user wants customised suggestions

**Response Structure:**

2. **Conversation starters per hook** — Specific questions/comments
3. **Tone options** — Funny, genuine, curious variations
4. **What not to do** — Generic approaches to avoid

**Key Rules:**
- Use actual details from the provided profile

4. **Perspective** — Brief reminder about healthy dating mindset

**Key Rules:**
- Be honest, even if it's not what they want to hear
- Don't enable toxic behaviour

## Anti-Patterns in Dating Coach Responses

Things the Dating Coach should NEVER do:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Instead |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Generic advice | Doesn't help the specific situation | Use details they provided |
| Lecture tone | Feels preachy, user tunes out | Talk like a friend |

| False certainty | "She definitely likes you" | Acknowledge uncertainty |
| Toxic positivity | "You're amazing, their loss!" | Be honest about reality |
| Encouraging games | "Make them jealous" | Promote direct communication |
| Judgmental | "That's stupid" | Understand, then redirect |
| Creepy suggestions | Objectifying or boundary-crossing | Respect-based openers |
