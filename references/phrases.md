# Phrases to Avoid in Dating & Relationships

## Manipulative Openers & Pick-Up Lines

These phrases treat connection as a transaction. Replace with genuine curiosity.

- "You're not like other girls/guys"
- "I don't usually do this, but..."
- "You'd be prettier if you smiled more"
- "Are you always this [adjective]?"
- "I can tell you're different"
- "Let me guess—you're a [zodiac sign]"
- "You look like you need saving"
- "I bet guys/girls are always hitting on you"
- "You're too good for this place"
- "What's a girl/guy like you doing here alone?"

**Instead:** Ask genuine questions. "What are you reading?" "How do you know [mutual friend]?" "I liked what you said about [topic]."

## Toxic Positivity in Heartbreak

These bypass real emotions. Allow space for grief.

- "Their loss, queen/king!"
- "You dodged a bullet, trust me"
- "Everything happens for a reason"
- "You'll find someone better, I promise"
- "At least you learned something"
- "The universe has a plan for you"
- "Just focus on yourself, sab theek ho jayega"
- "Time heals everything"
- "You're too good for them anyway"
- "They didn't deserve you"

**Instead:** "That sounds really painful. I'm here if you want to talk." "It's okay to feel sad—take the time you need."

## Passive-Aggressive Communication

These create confusion. Say what you actually mean.

| Avoid | Say Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "It's fine." (when it's not) | "Actually, I'm feeling hurt about this" |
| "Do what you want" | "I'd prefer if we could..." |
| "I'm not mad" (while clearly upset) | "I am upset, and here's why..." |
| "Whatever makes you happy" | "I have a different preference—can we discuss?" |
| "Must be nice" | "I wish I had that too" |
| "Interesting choice" | "I don't understand—can you explain?" |
| "K" / "Cool" / "Fine" | "I need some time to process this" |
| "I guess I'll just..." | "I need [specific thing] from you" |
| "No worries" (when there are worries) | "I was disappointed when..." |
| "Theek hai, jo tum bolo" | "I don't fully agree—here's my perspective" |

## Pressure & Guilt-Tripping Phrases

These manipulate through obligation. Respect autonomy instead.

- "If you really loved me, you would..."
- "After everything I've done for you"
- "I guess I'm just not important to you"
- "Fine, I'll just be alone then"
- "You always do this to me"
- "Everyone else's partner does [X]"
- "My ex never had a problem with this"
- "You're being too sensitive"
- "I was just joking, why are you getting emotional?"
- "Itna bhi kya hai, chill karo"

**Instead:** Express needs without blame. "I feel disconnected when we don't spend time together. Can we figure something out?"

## Dating "Rules" That Create Anxiety

These treat relationships like strategy games. Replace with authenticity.

- "Wait 3 days before texting"
- "Never double text"
- "Make them chase you"
- "Play hard to get"
- "Don't be too available"
- "Keep them guessing"
- "Let them make the first move"
- "Don't seem too eager"
- "Always leave them wanting more"
- "Thoda attitude rakhna chahiye"

**Instead:** Respond when you feel like it. Express interest honestly. Availability isn't weakness—it's clarity.

## Dismissive Responses to Vulnerability

These shut down emotional connection. Create safety instead.

| Avoid | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| "You're overthinking" | Invalidates their processing style |
| "Calm down" | Escalates distress, feels dismissive |
| "It's not a big deal" | Minimises their experience |
| "Why are you making this about you?" | Punishes emotional expression |
| "You're being dramatic" | Shames emotional response |
| "Let it go" | Dismisses unresolved feelings |
| "Can we not do this right now?" | Avoids necessary conversation |
| "You always bring this up" | Signals the issue was never resolved |
| "Drama mat karo" | Shames legitimate emotional needs |
| "Acha theek hai, sorry bol diya" | Dismisses without understanding |

**Instead:** "Help me understand why this is important to you." "I can see you're upset—what do you need from me right now?"

## Attachment-Avoidant Language

These create distance. Practise moving toward connection.

- "I need space" (without context or timeline)
- "I don't want to label things"
- "Let's just see where this goes"
- "I'm not good at relationships"
- "I don't do emotions"
- "You knew what you signed up for"
- "I told you I was complicated"
- "Main aise hi hoon, accept karo"
- "I'm just bad at texting"
- "I don't like talking about feelings"

**Instead:** "I need some time to process—can we talk tomorrow evening?" "I'm not ready to define this yet, but I am invested in seeing where we go."

---

## Comparison & Competition Phrases

These create insecurity. Focus on your unique connection.

- "My friend's boyfriend/girlfriend does [X]"
- "Why can't you be more like [person]?"
- "My ex used to..."
- "Other couples don't have this problem"
- "At least [person] understands me"
- "Even my parents think you should..."
- "Dekho [friend] ka partner kitna caring hai"
- "Everyone says I deserve better"

**Instead:** Address the specific need. "I'd appreciate more [specific behaviour]. Can we work on this together?"

---

## Boundary-Violating Questions (Early Dating)

These feel invasive too soon. Respect the pace of intimacy.

- "Why are you still single?"
- "How many people have you dated?"
- "What's your body count?"
- "Why did your last relationship end?"
- "When do you want to get married?"
- "Salary kitni hai?" / "Family background kya hai?"
- "Do your parents know about me?"
- "Are you talking to other people?"

**Instead:** Let deeper questions emerge naturally as trust builds. Focus on present connection over past inventory.

## Key Principles for Healthy Language

1. **Say what you mean.** Hints create confusion; clarity creates safety.
2. **Own your feelings.** "I feel X" not "You make me X."
3. **Request, don't demand.** "Would you be willing to..." not "You need to..."
4. **Validate before problem-solving.** "That sounds hard" before "Have you tried..."
5. **Respect autonomy.** Everyone gets to have their own boundaries, pace, and preferences.
