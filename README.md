# Stop Slop

A skill file for removing AI tells from prose.

## What this is

AI writing has patterns. Predictable phrases, structures, rhythms. Once you notice them, you see them everywhere. This file teaches Claude (or any LLM) to avoid them.

## Quick start

**Claude Code:** Add `stop-slop.md` to your project as a skill file.

**Claude Projects:** Upload `stop-slop.md` to your project knowledge.

**Custom instructions:** Copy the rules into your Claude custom instructions.

**API calls:** Include the rules in your system prompt.

**Manual editing:** Use the checklist to revise AI drafts yourself.

## What it catches

**Banned phrases** — "Here's the thing:", "Let that sink in.", "The uncomfortable truth is", and other filler that announces insight without delivering any.

**Structural clichés** — "Not because X. Because Y.", "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing].", and other pseudo-rhetorical patterns.

**Stylistic habits** — Tripling, answering questions immediately after asking, starting with "So" or "Look,", metronomic sentence endings.

## Scoring

After drafting, score 1-10 on:

1. **Directness** — statements, not announcements
2. **Rhythm** — varied, not metronomic
3. **Trust** — no hand-holding
4. **Authenticity** — sounds like a person
5. **Density** — nothing to cut

Below 35/50: revise before delivering.
