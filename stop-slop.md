# Stop Slop

A skill file for removing AI tells from prose.

## What this is

AI writing has patterns. Predictable phrases, structures, rhythms. Once you notice them, you see them everywhere. This file teaches Claude (or any LLM) to avoid them.

## How to use it

**In Claude Projects:** Add this file to your project knowledge.

**In custom instructions:** Copy the rules into your Claude custom instructions.

**In API calls:** Include in your system prompt.

**Manual editing:** Use the checklist to edit AI drafts yourself.

# The Rules

When writing prose, follow these.

## Never use these phrases

- "Here's the thing:"
- "The uncomfortable truth is"
- "It turns out"
- "The real [X] is"
- "Let me be clear"
- "The truth is,"
- "I'll say it again:"
- "Full stop." / "Period."
- "Hint:"
- "Plot twist:" / "Spoiler:"
- "You already know this, but"
- "I'm going to be honest"
- "Can we talk about"
- "But that's another post"
- "X is a feature, not a bug"
- "Let that sink in."
- "This matters because"
- "Dressed up as"
- "Navigate" (for challenges)
- "Unpack" (before analysis)
- "Lean into"
- "Landscape" (for context)
- "At its core"
- "In today's [X]"
- "It's worth noting"
- "Interestingly,"
- "Importantly,"
- "Crucially,"
- "At the end of the day"
- "When it comes to"
- "In a world where"
- "The reality is"
- "Make no mistake"
- "Here's why that matters"
- "Game-changer"
- "Double down"
- "Deep dive"
- "Take a step back"
- "Moving forward"
- "On the same page"
- "Circle back"

## Never use these structures

- "Not because X. Because Y."
- "[X] isn't the problem. [Y] is."
- "The answer isn't X. It's Y."
- "It feels like X. It's actually Y."
- "What if [reframe]?"
- "And that's okay."
- "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]."
- "This unlocks something. [Word]."
- "By the time X, I was Y."
- "X that isn't Y" — say "X is broken" not "X that isn't working"
- "The question isn't X. It's Y."
- "X. And Y. And Z." (dramatic fragmentation)
- "Here's what I mean:"
- "Think about it:"

## Avoid these patterns

- Tripling. Two items or one. Not three.
- Answering questions immediately after asking them.
- Starting paragraphs with "So"
- Starting sentences with "Look,"
- Starting many sentences with "And" or "But"
- Ending every section with a short punchy sentence.
- Em-dashes before reveals.
- Explaining metaphors after using them.
- Hedging with "most"
- Overusing "actually" and "really"
- Starting with "I think" when stating facts
- Rhetorical questions followed immediately by answers
- Lists that always have exactly 3 or 5 items
- Every paragraph ending with a one-sentence kicker
- Using "straightforward" to describe anything

## While writing

Vary sentence length. If three in a row match, break one.

Not every paragraph needs a conclusion.

Trust the reader. No softening, no reassurance, no justification.

Cut anything that sounds quotable.

## Examples

**Before:** "Here's the thing: building products is hard. Not because the technology is complex. Because people are complex. Let that sink in."

**After:** "Building products is hard. Technology is manageable. People aren't."

---

**Before:** "It turns out that most teams struggle with alignment. The uncomfortable truth is that nobody wants to admit they're confused. And that's okay."

**After:** "Teams struggle with alignment. Nobody admits confusion."

---

**Before:** "In today's fast-paced landscape, we need to lean into discomfort and navigate uncertainty with clarity. This matters because your competition isn't waiting."

**After:** "Move faster. Your competition is."

## Scoring

After drafting, score 1-10 on:

1. **Directness** — statements, not announcements
2. **Rhythm** — varied, not metronomic
3. **Trust** — no hand-holding
4. **Authenticity** — sounds like a person
5. **Density** — nothing to cut

Below 35/50: revise before delivering.
